This mutator brings Marco's DooM 3 monsters up-to-date.
Version [b]9.69.45[/b].

Major changes:
[list]
[*] Made fully compatible with the latest KF version.
[*] Reworked monster balance.
[*] New end game boss behavior.
[*] Fixed many hitboxes (not all though).
[/list]

[u]Compatibility changes:[/u]
[list]
[*] Sharpshooter receives normal headshot multiplier bonus for perked weapons.
[*] Fixed burning behavior of all new Firebug weapons.
[*] Implemented alternate burning mechanism from ScrN Balance.
[*] Players now receive normal bounties for killing/hitting DooM3 monsters (including assists).
[*] Last 5 monsters now can be auto-killed by the engine the same way as regular zeds. No more wasting a couple if minutes on looking for stuck doom monsters every end of the wave (but they sometimes they do stuck, tbh).
[*] Bosses can't be auto-killed, so they must be defeated.
[*] Applied pipebomb treat levels for smaller monsters. Single spiders won't detonate pipebomb anymore.
[/list]


[u]Balance changes:[/u]
[list]
[*] Big doom monsters get 30% damage resistance to Xbow/M99 headshots on Sui/HoE. Resistance is applied to Bruiser, Archvile, Mancubus, Hell Knight and all bosses.
[*] Big monsters' health now is scaled through the number of players. Monsters with scaled health: Commando, Revenant, Bruiser, Archvile, Mancubus, HellKnight. Health of the other monsters remains constant for a given difficulty.
[*] Imp's fireballs now sets players on fire (but base damage is lowered by 25%).
[*] Imp, Archive and Forgotten are resistant to burning. Firebug is almost useless against those creatures, but from be other side, he is immune to their projectiles (flames) too.
[*] Raised Fat Zombie and Boney's speed.
[*] Revenant can be raged.
[*] Lowered Maledict's health and melee damage. Even after the nerf, he still remains the most dangerous boss.

[b][u]End game boss[/u][/b]
Now end game boss fight against doom boss will be a real challenge, introducing new features.

Unlike Patriarch, Doom boss doesn't heal, but he has more health and from time to time he is spawning sidekicks (regular doom monsters) to help in the battle. Boss spawns sidekicks the same way as Archvile does - they are teleported directly from Hell next to the boss. Sidekick spawn rate depends from two factors: damage factor and time factor.
The more damage boss receives, the higher damage factor raises, meaning more and tougher zeds will spawn. So just spamming shots into the boss will make team surrounded by doom monsters and [probably] get wiped. However, even if boss doesn't get hurt for a while, time factor will still be in place and sidekicks will be spawning. So team must split their resources on both fighting the boss and getting rid of the sidekicks.
